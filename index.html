							<h2>Ask ChatGPT: What is New York Pizza?</h2>
							<p>New York-style pizza is a style of pizza characterized by large, hand-tossed thin crusts and a liberal
								use of tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. It's a derivative of the original Neapolitan pizza from Italy
								but has been adapted to meet the tastes and preferences of New Yorkers. This style of pizza is typically
								cooked in a gas oven, which contributes to its distinct crisp edge and slightly chewy center.</p>

							<p>A hallmark of New York-style pizza is its flexibility; the slices are large and wide with a thin crust
								that is foldable yet crispy on the edges. This makes it easy to eat on the go, which suits the
								fast-paced
								lifestyle of New York City. Toppings can vary widely, but the classic New York slice features a simple
								layer of tomato sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese. Additional toppings are often layered on this
								base,
								including pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers.</p>

							<p>New York-style pizza is served in both pizzerias and by the slice, a nod to the city's bustling street
								food scene. The ability to buy a single slice of pizza and eat it as street food is a defining
								characteristic of New York's pizza culture. This style of pizza has become immensely popular across the
								United States and has influenced the development of other regional pizza styles.</p>
